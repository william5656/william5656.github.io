        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p class="aboutme">
            I used to work in the hospitality, worked as a dishwasher, cook, sous chef, experiencing many different types of cooking styles.
            It was really enjoyable being able to work with many different kinds of people with different backgrounds. Later on I've become
            really intrested in the field of coding as its enjoyable to create something, to design and to solve problems, like a puzzle and 
            that to me is fun.
